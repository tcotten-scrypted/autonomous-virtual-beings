## Analysis
The model demonstrates simple learning characteristics:
1. Rapid convergence to transformation rules
2. Consistent behavior across different epoch counts
3. Ability to learn simple cyclic patterns with minimal computational resources

Key Observations:
- Full v_scale takes longer with 2 active tokens than no v_scaling
- Converges to stability for small cyclic patterns quickly
- Undefined inputs show consistent (though arbitrary) fallback behaviors

Implications:
- Tiny transformers can learn simple sequence transformations
- 2-token context window is sufficient for basic cyclic patterns
- Label smoothing helps prevent exact memorization

This experiment showcases the potential of minimalist transformer architectures in learning fundamental sequence manipulation tasks.
