    LoyaltyCore

    Overview:
    ----------
    The LoyaltyCore class extends AVBCore to implement loyalty-based behaviors
    for the Autonomous Virtual Being (AVB). This core monitors and manages
    interactions with designated loyalty targets, such as following or liking
    specific social media interactions.

    This stub provides a skeleton for the LoyaltyCore, implementing basic 
    lifecycle methods inherited from AVBCore. Further logic can be added to
    define loyalty-target actions in `_tick()`.

    Attributes:
    ------------
    - targets : list
        List of loyalty targets to be managed by the core.

    Methods:
    --------
    - initialize(self):
        Loads loyalty targets and prepares the core for operation.

    - _tick(self):
        Checks loyalty targets and performs any necessary interactions 
        each time the agent calls the core's tick.

    - shutdown(self):
        Cleans up resources related to loyalty management.
